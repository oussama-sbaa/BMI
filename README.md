# Body Mass Index (BMI) Web Service

This is a simple web service project that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. The project is developed using Node.js, Express, and Nuxt.js.

The server-side of the application is built using the Express framework for Node.js. It handles the BMI calculation and provides an API endpoint that accepts height and weight values, and returns the corresponding BMI value and health status.

The client-side of the application is built using Nuxt.js. It provides a simple user interface where users can enter their height and weight values and see their corresponding BMI value and health status.
